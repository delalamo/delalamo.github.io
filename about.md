I'm a computational biologist and structural bioinformatician with fifteen years of research experience, including ten years in the wet lab. Currently I engineer and design biotherapeutics and protein reagents at GSK using a combination of classical modeling and machine learning tools. My background is in experimental and computational biophysics of membrane proteins (transporters), and I am personally interested in protein dynamics and evolution.

## Work and Research Experience
### GSK (Baar, ZG, Switzerland)
**Investigator - Protein Design & Informatics (May 2022 - Present)**
*   My primary responsibilities involve the rational design and multi-parameter optimization of antibodies and other proteins using a combination of sequence- and structure-based modeling tools. As part of this role I interface with experimental groups to build upon previous-round datasets under both data-poor and data-rich conditions
*   Antibody engineering: applying a combination of physics-based methods, simple predictive models, and AI/ML tools for various engineering challenges such as de-risking of immunogenicity, solubility, specificity, thermostability, expression, and patent infringement
*   Enzyme engineering: identifying starting points for directed evolution campaigns using bioinformatics search tools, structural modeling, and ligand-binding pocket featurization
*   Writing and distributing Python scripts across GSK R&D for molecular modeling and analysis, including rapid retrieval from the AlphaFold2 database of 200 million protein models, in silico linker screening and ranking, and modeling of alternate conformational states of diverse proteins such as viral fusion proteins
*   Preparing manuscripts for publication, and presenting findings at scientific conferences

### Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN, USA)
**Postdoctoral Researcher (Aug 2021 - Apr 2022)**
*   Initiated and led a multi-departmental project focused on designing and testing transformer- and CNN-based AI/ML methods for processing electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy data
*   Identified, developed, and published methods to model conformational changes in membrane proteins, such as transporters and G-protein coupled receptors, using AlphaFold2 and Rosetta
*   Concluded my PhD research work (see below)
**Graduate Student/Research Assistant (Aug 2015 - Aug 2021)**
*   My PhD research work focused on the experimental and computational characterization of the membrane transporter GadC. This interdisciplinary project involved a combination of spectroscopy measurements, activity assays, and integrative modeling using experimental data as geometric restraints.
*   Supervised and mentored one undergraduate, one Master's student, one research assistant, and two Ph.D. rotation students
*   Taught and co-hosted twelve interactive in-person and remote workshops and courses

### Karyopharm Therapeutics (Newton, MA, USA)
**Senior Research Associate (Jan 2014 - May 2015)**

*   Maintained cell culture stocks of human and mammalian cells

**Research Associate (Jul 2012 - Dec 2013)**
*   Designed, implemented, and managed data trackers to monitor blood and plasma samples collected during Phase I and II clinical trials
*   Wrote preclinical dosing schedules and interfaced with academic partners and contract research organizations
*   Proofread patents for small molecules, verified that reported values and structures matched internal data

## Side projects

*   **[PubMedBERT literature fetcher](https://github.com/delalamo/PubMedFetcher):** A cloud-based app that emails me papers I might find interesting on a daily basis. It is hosted on Heroku and 1) scrapes biorxiv, arxiv, and PubMED for new submissions each morning, 2) uses large language models to embed their abstracts, and 3) calculates relevance using a custom-trained regression model. I receive an e-mail every weekday morning at 8AM GMT with the results.

*   **[Protein structural modelling and design Zettelkasten](https://publish.obsidian.md/ddelalamo/Sorted_notes/Protein+structural+modeling+and+design+Zettelkasten):** A wiki I run that sorts and summarizes information from over 500 recent protein design and modelling papers.
